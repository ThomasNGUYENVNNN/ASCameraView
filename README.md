cameraLib
=========

A camera lib for iOS

Some features to implement (not a prioritized list, just brainstorming):

- [ ] flash - on off auto toggle and functionality
 
- [ ] HDR on/off toggle (and maybe specifying the bracketing?)

- [ ] front/back camera toggle

- [ ] focus rectangle (color, functionality)

- [ ] pinch digital zoom

- [ ] default crops (photo, square)

- [ ] mode toggle (video, photo, square, pano)

- [ ] camera roll preview thumbnail

- [ ] live effect preview

- video 

 - [ ] take pictures while video is recording

 - [ ] show video run time

- pano

 - [ ] show stability arrow

 - [ ]  allow long shutter photo taking

- [ ] customize buttons

- [ ] customize background color



Some neat third-party features include:

- [ ] Holding down to record videos vine-style (stop motion/starting and stopping)

- [ ] using both cameras simultaenously

- [ ] adding custom overlays to the image (i.e. seene)
